# 🍪 IsoBiscuit – The Virtual Biscuit Machine 🚀  

**IsoBiscuit** is a powerful tool for virtualizing processes and tasks written in **Biscuit Assembly**.  

🔄 Your code is compiled into a `.biscuit` file – a pure **hex format**.  
❗ If you open the file and see weird characters: **Don't panic!** That’s completely normal because this format is not designed for ASCII.  

✨ **Features:**  
✅ Virtual execution of Biscuit Assembly   
✅ Compact and optimized `.biscuit` files  

💡 **Why IsoBiscuit?**  
🎯 Ideal for simulations and testing
